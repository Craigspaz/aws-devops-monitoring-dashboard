# Solution Overview

The AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard solution is a reference implementation that automates the process for monitoring and visualizing performance and operational metrics in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline following AWS best practices. This solution allows organizations of all sizes to track and measure the activities of their development teams. This helps DevOps leaders measure the impact of their DevOps initiatives and make data-driven decisions to drive continuous improvement in their software delivery process.

This solution supports ingestion, analysis and visualization of data from AWS Developer Tools to calculate key DevOps metrics, such as Change Failure Rate, Deployment, Code Change Volume and more. These metrics are presented in Amazon QuickSight dashboards for visualization.

This solution can be easily installed in your AWS accounts via launching the provided AWS CloudFormation template.

For a detailed solution implementation guide, refer to Solution Landing Page [AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard)

# Architecture Diagram

  <br/>
</p>

1.	A developer initiates an activity in an AWS CI/CD pipeline, such as pushing a code change to AWS CodeCommit or deploying an application using AWS CodeDeploy. These activities create events.
2.	An Amazon EventBridge events rule detects the events based on predefined event patterns and then sends the event data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. One event rule is created per event source.
3.	An Amazon EventBridge events rule is also created to capture events from an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors the status of an Amazon CloudWatch synthetics canary, if you have set up the canary and alarm in your account. This alarm is needed to gather data for calculating Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) metrics.
4.	Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose uses an AWS Lambda function for data transformation. The Lambda function extracts relevant data to each metric and sends it to an Amazon S3 bucket for downstream processing.
5.	An Amazon Athena database queries the Amazon S3 bucket data and returns query results to Amazon QuickSight.
6.	Amazon QuickSight obtains the query results and builds dashboard visualizations for your management team.

# AWS Solutions Constructs
[AWS CDK Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create well-architected applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This solution uses the following AWS CDK Constructs:

# Customizing the Solution

## Prerequisites for Customization

* [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Python 3.8

## Build

Building from GitHub source will allow you to modify the solution, such as adding custom actions or upgrading to a new release. The process consists of downloading the source from GitHub, creating Amazon S3 buckets to store artifacts for deployment, building the solution, and uploading the artifacts to S3 in your account.

#### 1. Clone the repository

Clone or download the repository to a local directory on your linux client. Note: if you intend to modify the source code you may wish to create your own fork of the GitHub repo and work from that. This allows you to check in any changes you make to your private copy of the solution.

**Git Clone example:**

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard.git
```

**Download Zip example:**
```
wget https://github.com/awslabs/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard/archive/master.zip
```

#### 2. Create S3 buckets for storing deployment assets

AWS Solutions use two buckets:

* One global bucket that is access via the http end point. AWS CloudFormation templates are stored here. Ex. "mybucket"
* One regional bucket for each region where you plan to deploy the solution. Use the name of the global bucket as the prefix of the bucket name, and suffixed with the region name. Regional assets such as Lambda code are stored here. Ex. "mybucket-us-east-1"
* The assets in buckets must be accessible by your account

#### 03. Declare enviroment variables
```
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=<YOUR_TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET> # Name of the global bucket where CloudFormation template is stored
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=<YOUR_DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET> # Name for the regional bucket where regional assets are stored
export SOLUTION_NAME="aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard" # name of the solution
export VERSION=<VERSION> # version number for the customized solution
export AWS_REGION=<AWS_REGION> # region where the solution is deployed
export QUICKSIGHT_TEMPLATE_ACCOUNT = <YOUR_QUICKSIGHT_TEMPLATE_ACCOUNT> # The AWS account from which the Amazon QuickSight templates should be sourced for Amazon QuickSight Analysis and Dashboard creation
export DIST_QUICKSIGHT_NAMESPACE = <YOUR_DIST_QUICKSIGHT_NAMESPACE >
# The namesapce in QuickSight account ARN. Ex. "default"
```
#### 04. Build the solution
```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION $CF_TEMPLATE_BUCKET_NAME $QUICKSIGHT_TEMPLATE_ACCOUNT $DIST_QUICKSIGHT_NAMESPACE
```

#### 05. Run Unit Tests

```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

Confirm that all unit tests pass.

#### 06. Upload deployment assets to your buckets

Run upload_s3_dist.sh, passing the name of the region where you want to deploy the solution (ex. us-east-1). Note that this prepares your templates for deployment, but does not do the actual deployment in your account.
```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
./upload_s3_dist.sh $AWS_REGION
```

<a name="unit-test"></a>
## Unit Test

```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

Confirm that all unit tests pass.

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy

* From your designated Amazon S3 bucket where you uploaded the deployment assets, copy the link location for the aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard.template.
* Using AWS CloudFormation, launch the AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard solution stack using the copied Amazon S3 link for the aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard.template.
